Liza Testing Library
====================

This namespace contains a library to aid in the testing of code that _makes
use of_ Liza.  Especially due to legacy reasons, there are some parts of the
system that are quite difficult to mock and work with.

For test cases of Liza itself, see `/test' in the project root (sibling of
`/src').

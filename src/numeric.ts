 * TypeScript's type system does not support algebraic numeric domains.  A
 * compromise is to provide nominal types that allow developers to assume
 * that some constraint has been met, and then ensure that the type is only
 * ever asserted when that constraint is explicitly validated at
 * runtime.  This allows us to have compile-time checks on numeric values
 * under the assumption that the runtime will enforce them.
 *
 * For this to work, _it is important to always use type predicates_;
 * if you explicit cast to one of these numeric types, it circumvents the
 * safety provided by the system and may introduce nasty bugs, since users
 * of these types assume the provided data has already been validated.

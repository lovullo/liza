 *
 * XXX: Various parts of the system (like dialogs and certain groups) use
 * jQuery UI.  This will change in the future, but this drastically affects
 * how the dialog is styled.  This CSS file _does no_ provide a jQuery UI
 * theme.
 *
 * XXX: Further, since jQuery UI's dialog styles are _inlined_ as the @style
 * of the element itself, we need `!important'.

/* Navigation Dialogs
 * ------------------
 * The dialog prompting for document (quote) id changes contains three
 * separate buttons with sizable text, and so should be wide.
 */

  width: 60ch !important;
}

/* The document (quote) number dialog prompts for a number to view.  Really,
 * this should be consolodated with the above.  It contains only an input
 * box prefixed by 'WEB', with some descriptive text above it, and an OK
 * button.
 */

/* When skipping between steps using the upper navigation, the
 * "DirtyÂ Dialog" asks whether the user wants to save or discard
 * changes.  It contains a third button---cancel---and should be wide enough
 * to accommodate.

/* General-Purpose Dialogs
 * -----------------------
 * The Error Dialog shows a generic message for normal users, and error
 * details for internal users.

/* Developer Dialog
 * ----------------
 * The developer dialog is intended for internal users to be able to inspect
 * and modify the current state of the system.  It is intended to be
 * non-modal and toggleable.
 *
 * This dialog contains a lot of information, so the default size should be
 * considerable.  However, it should not be so large as to conceal the
 * entire page by default, as certain types of interactions are reflected on
 * the page itself.

 * Dialog.  It should be tall, as there tends to be a great amount of bucket
 * values, and wide enough to display a good portion of a vector of strings
 * (e.g. multi-index street addresses).

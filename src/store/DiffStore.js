/**
 * Lazily compute diffs since last change
 *
 * This store recursively calculates the diff of scalars and
 * objects.  Unlike many other stores, you don't always get out what you put
 * in.
 *
 * There are three operations:
 *   - `#add` stages a change to a key;
 *   - `#get` calculates the diff of a key against its committed value; and
 *   - `#clear` commits staged values, clearing all diffs.
 *
 * Values are recursively compared until a scalar is found.  If the scalar
 * matches the committed value, it is recognized as unchanged and
 * represented as `undefined`.  Otherwise, the staged value takes its
 * place.
 *
 * @example
 *   // Promise resolving to [ undefined, "quux" ]
 *   DiffStore()
 *       .add( 'foo', [ "bar", "baz" ] )
 *       .then( store => store.clear() )
 *       .add( 'foo', [ "bar", "quux" ] )
 *       .then( store => store.get( 'foo' ) )
 *
 *   // Promise resolving to { foo: undefined, baz: [ undefined, 'c' ] }
 *   DiffStore()
 *       .add( 'foo', { foo: 'bar', baz: [ 'a', 'b', ] } )
 *       .then( store => store.clear() )
 *       .add( 'foo', { baz: [ 'a', 'c' ] } )
 *       .then( store => store.get( 'foo' ) )
 *
 * The union of all keys of all objects are included in the diff:
 *
 * @example
 *   // Promise resolving to { foo: undefined, baz: 'quux' }
 *   DiffStore()
 *       .add( 'foo', { foo: 'bar' } )
 *       .then( store => store.clear() )
 *       .add( 'foo', { baz: 'quux' } )
 *       .then( store => store.get( 'foo' ) )
 *
 * Values are diff'd since the last `#clear`, so adding a value multiple
 * times will compare only the last one:
 *
 * @example
 *   // Promise resolving to undefined
 *   DiffStore()
 *       .add( 'foo', 'foo' )
 *       .then( store => store.clear() )
 *       .add( 'foo', 'bar' )
 *       .add( 'foo', 'baz' )
 *       .add( 'foo', 'foo' )
 *       .then( store => store.get( 'foo' ) )
 *
 *   // Promise resolving to undefined
 *   DiffStore()
 *       .add( 'foo', 'bar' )
 *       .then( store => store.clear() )
 *       .then( store => store.get( 'foo' ) )
 *
 * One caveat: since the diff represents the absence of changes as
 * `undefined`, there is no way to distinguish between an actual undefined
 * value and a non-change.  If this is important to you, you can subtype
 * this class and override `#diff`.
 *
 * For more examples, see the `DiffStoreTest` test case.

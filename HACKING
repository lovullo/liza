Publishing New Versions
=======================
To build and publish a new version on NPM:

- Tag version with 'v' prefix using semver (https://semver.org/)
- Regenerate `configure' with version information:
    $ ./autogen.sh
- Test:
    $ ./configure && make
- Create tarball:
    $ make dist
- Login (only necessary for first-time publishers)
    $ npm login
- Publish:
    $ npm publish liza-VERSION.tar.gz

If your system cannot create a distribution tarball for whatever reason
(e.g. because of large user/group ids), then you'll have to create a
distribution directory instead:

- Create distribution:
    $ make distdir
- Publish:
    $ npm publish liza-VERSION/


If you have a personal account on NPM, you may use that; otherwise,
use the `lovullo' account.

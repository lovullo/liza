Liza is a data collection, validation, and processing framework for JavaScript.

**This project is under active development; please check back later as we make
it available.**


## About
The Liza Data Collection Framework&mdash;"Liza" for short&mdash;is an effort
to clean up, formalize, and expand upon a framework that was developed at
RT Specialty / LoVullo for collecting, validating, and processing large amounts
of user input for insurance quoting.  As existing code is refactored or its
design improved upon, it will begin its life as part of Liza; please be
patient as the entire core framework makes its way into this repository and
others.


## Configuring
If your distribution does not contain a `configure' file in the project
root, then you likely have the sources as committed to the project
repository; you may generate the script by issuing the following command:

```
  $ ./autogen.sh
```

You may then see `./configure --help` for more information.

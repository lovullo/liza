This project is developed internally at RT Specialty / LoVullo.


Publishing New Versions
=======================
To build and publish a new version on NPM:

- Bump version in configure.ac
- Test:
    $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
- Tag version with 'v' prefix
- Create tarball:
    $ make dist
- Publish:
    $ npm publish liza-VERSION.tar.gz

If you have a personal account on NPM, you may use that; otherwise,
use the `lovullo' account.
